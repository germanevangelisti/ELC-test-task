### Prerequisites

* NodeJS (v10.15.3)
* NPM (v6.9.0)

### Step 1 - Node Modules

The first thing you need to do to get this app working is to install the Node modules with the following command:

    npm install

### Step 2 - Running the App

After installing the Node modules, you must start two locally hosted servers. The first server is the Node back end server, which runs the NodeJS files found in the './server' folder, and the second is the front end server, which runs the ReactJS app files found in the './app' folder. Both servers can be started by running the following command (make sure youâ€™re using the correct versions of Node and NPM per the prerequisites above):

    npm run servers

This command will create a front end server at http://localhost:3030 (which should automatically open in your browser), and it will start the Node back end server at http://localhost:3035, with Nodemon, so that updates happen automatically on save. 

*Special Note for Windows Users*

On Windows systems, you may get an error like the following:

  'NODE_ENV' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
  
If so, you will need to replace any occurrences of NODE_ENV with 'SET NODE_ENV' in the package.json, and separate this command from the one that follows it with a '&', like this:
  "node-server": "SET NODE_ENV=development & nodemon server/app.js"
